**Created**: 2025-12-23\
**Feature**:
[spec.md](file:///Users/moment/Projects/personal/projects/saas/stop-read/specs/001-ai-tab-grouping/spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

### Validation Complete

All checklist items have been addressed:

- Added "Assumptions" section documenting dependencies on Goals system, AI
  provider, Chrome Extension APIs, tab content access permissions, storage
  capacity, and browser tab grouping support
- All functional requirements are testable and have clear acceptance criteria
- Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- Edge cases are identified and documented
- User scenarios cover all primary flows with independent tests

### Overall Assessment

The specification is **ready for planning** (`/speckit.plan`). All critical
sections are complete, requirements are testable, success criteria are
measurable and technology-agnostic, and all dependencies and assumptions are
explicitly documented.
